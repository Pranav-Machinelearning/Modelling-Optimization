Modelling and optimization with Gaussian Model

Abstract-- Cardiovascular disease is a generic term for any serious heart-related illness. Because heart disorders can be fatal, scientists are concentrating on developing intelligent systems that employ machine learning algorithms to precisely identify heart ailments based on electronic health data. This article uses patient data on key health indicators to provide multiple machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction. The study presented four classification techniques, using Gaussian Processes to construct prediction models. Prior to creating the models, phases for feature selection and data pretreatment were completed. The models were assessed using the F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. The accuracy of the Gaussian model was 6.44%.
Improving preprocessing and creating new features or employing feature selection techniques can enhance the model's input, potentially leading to better accuracy, precision, and F1-score, thus boosting its predictive performance.
